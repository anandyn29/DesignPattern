emplate Method Design Pattern defines a sequence of steps of an algorithm and allows the subclasses to override the steps
but is not allowed to change the sequence. 

Actors:
1. AbstractTemplate  --> HouseTemplate.cs
2. ConcreteTemplates  --> WoodenHouse.cs.cs,ConcreteHouse.cs
3. Client --> Program.cs

When to use:
1. When you have a multi-step algorithm, and you want to ensure that the algorithm’s structure remains unchanged while allowing the steps to be overridden by subclasses.
2. In scenarios where code duplication can be reduced by generalizing the framework in an abstract class i.e TemplateClass.
