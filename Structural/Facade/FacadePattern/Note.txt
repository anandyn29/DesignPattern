The primary goal of the Facade(Face off) pattern is to present a clear, simplified, and minimized interface to the external clients 
while delegating all the complex underlying operations to the appropriate classes within the system. 
The Facade (usually a wrapper) class sits on the top of a group of subsystems and allows them to communicate in a unified manner.

Actors :
1. Facade --> OrderProduct.cs  
2. Subsystem --> Product.cs, Invoice.cs, Payment.cs
3.  Client --> Program.cs

Advantages of Facade Design Pattern:
1. Simplified Interface: Offers a single, simplified interface to the complex subsystems, making the subsystems easier to use.
2. Reduced Complexity: Clients interact with a single unified interface rather than directly with the complex subsystems, reducing the system’s perceived complexity.
3. Isolation: Provides a degree of isolation from the complex subsystems, which can be beneficial when there are frequent subsystem changes.
