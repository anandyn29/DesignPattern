
The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. 
It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This pattern is useful when you want to use existing classes, but their interfaces do not match the one you need.

Actors :
1. Adaptee --> ThirdPartBillingSystem.cs
2. Adapter --> EmployeeAdapter.cs
3. Interface -- >  ITarget.cs
4. Client --> Program.cs

As you can see, the client uses the ITarget Interface and creates an instance of the Adapter(EmployeeAdapter), and using the Adapter instance, the client communicates with the Adaptee

When to use:
For example, if you have a Java class and want to make it compatible with the dot net class, 
then you need to use the Object Adapter Design Pattern because it is not possible to make the inheritance
