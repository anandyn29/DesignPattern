State Design Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. 
In simple words, we can say that the State Design Pattern allows an object to change its behavior depending on its current internal state. 

Actors:
1. AbstractState  --> IOrderState.cs
2. ConcreteState  --> NewState.cs,ProcessedState.cs,ShippedState.cs,DeliveredState.cs,CancelledState.cs
3. Context --> OrderContext.cs
4. Client --> Program.cs

Advantages of State Design Pattern:
1. Encapsulation of State-Based Behavior: State-specific logic is encapsulated in state classes.
2. Easy to Add New States: Introducing new states doesn’t require changing the context or other states.
