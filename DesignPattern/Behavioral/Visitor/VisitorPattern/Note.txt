
The Visitor Design Pattern should be used when you have distinct and unrelated operations to perform across a structure of objects (element objects). 
That means the Visitor Design is used to create and perform new operations on a set of objects without changing the object structure or classes.

Actors:
1. Element  --> IComputerParts.cs
2. ConcreteElement  --> CPU.cs, Monitor.cs, Printer.cs, HardDisk.cs
3. Visitor --> IComputerMaintainenceVisitorc.cs
4. ConcreteVisitor --> DiagnosticCheckVisitorc.cs,StatusCheckVisitorc.cs
5. Client  --> Program.cs

Use Cases of Visitor Design Pattern:
1. When you need to perform operations on a set of objects with different classes and you want to avoid type checks.
2. When new operations need to be added to complex class hierarchies without changing the classes themselves.
