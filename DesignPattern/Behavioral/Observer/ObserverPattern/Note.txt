
The Other names of this pattern are Producer/Consumer and Publish/Subscribe.

This Design Pattern is widely used for implementing distributed event-handling systems where an object needs to notify other objects about its state changes without knowing who these objects are. 
In the Observer Design Pattern, an object (called a Subject) maintains a list of its dependents (called Observers). 
It notifies them automatically whenever any state changes by calling one of their methods. 

Actors :
1. Publisher --> IStock.cs  
2. ConcretePublisher  --> Stock.cs  
3. Observer --> ITrader.cs  
4. ConcreteObserver --> Trader.cs
5. Client --> Program.cs

Advantages of Observer Design Pattern:
1. Loose Coupling: The subject and observers are loosely coupled. The subject knows nothing about the observers except that they implement the observer interface.
3. Dynamic Relationships: You can add and remove observers dynamically at runtime.
3. Broadcast Communication: The subject broadcasts notifications to all interested observers without knowing their details.

Use Cases Observer Design Pattern:
1. When a change to one object requires changing others, you don’t know how many objects need to be changed.
2. When an object should be able to notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are.
