Proxy is the object the client calls to access the real object behind the scene.
Proxy means in place of or on behalf of. That means, In the Proxy Design Pattern, a class represents the functionality of another class. 

In Proxy Design Pattern, there are two states, i.e., Intrinsic and Extrinsic.
1. Intrinsic states are things that are Constants and Stored in Memory. On the other hand, 
2. Extrinsic states are things that are not constant and need to be calculated on the Fly; hence, they can not be stored in memory.

Actors :
1. SubjectInterface --> ISharedFolder.cs  
2. RealSubject --> SharedFolder.cs
3. ProxyObject --> ShareFolderProxy.cs.cs
4. Client --> Program.cs

Advantages of Proxy Design Pattern:
1. Improve Performance using Proxy Server: The Proxy Servers can drastically improve the performance of the application.
	This is because it saves the results of a request for a certain period of time. 
	For example, two users, X and Y, want to access a particular resource through the Proxy Server. 
	First, user X requests a particular resource (a list of employees), and the Proxy Server gets the data from the real server. 
	Before sending the data to the client, it caches that resource (list of employees) for some time. Later, user Y also requests the same resource. 
	The Proxy Server, instead of forwarding that request to the Real Server (which is a time-consuming operation), 
	can return the data from the Cache, ultimately improving the application’s performance.\.
2. Filter Requests using Proxy Server: The Proxy Servers can also be used to filter incoming requests. 
	For example, a company might use a Proxy Server to prevent its employees from accessing a specific set of websites such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.
